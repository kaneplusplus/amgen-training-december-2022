",Southwest Oncology Group,Other,Bladder Cancer,Bladder,"A Phase III Blinded Study of Immediate Post TURBT Instillation of Gemcitabine Versus Saline in Patients With Newly Diagnosed or Occasionally Recurring Grade I/II Superficial Bladder CancerRATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder after surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder is more effective than a placebo in treating bladder cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine to see how well it works when given directly into the bladder compared with a placebo after surgery in treating patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent bladder cancer.

               -  More than a few clusters of small cell carcinoma are treated with different
                  chemotherapy and are ineligible for this study

               -  Patients with micropapillary tumor will be allowed irrespective of the extent of
                  transitional cell carcinoma. A transitional cell component is not required in the
                  setting of pure or extensive micropapillary tumors. Note that minor histologic

             have either grade 3 tumor, or a radiographic abnormality large enough to recognize as
             an abnormal mass by CT or MRI imaging. These patients may also be analyzed separately,
             since we do not have benchmark data for upper tract disease.

          5. Patients must have an evaluation in the department of urology, and be deemed an
             acceptable surgical candidate.

          7. Patients (Pts) must NOT have clinical evidence of disease beyond the involved organ by
             either CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest X-ray. Pts with lymph node
             involvement are not eligible. In absence of a bone scan, pts should be free of bone
             pain and have an alk. phos. < 150% of the ULN, or a normal bone fraction of alk. phos.
             If these features are present, pts should have a bone scan and this should be
             interpreted as showing no evidence of metastatic disease to be eligible. In case of
             bladder tumors, cancer invading local organs (pT4a) but not pelvis sidewall (pT4b) are
             allowed.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., who has had menses at any time in the
             preceding 24 consecutive months) must have a negative pregnancy test. Elevations of
             BHCG which are related to tumor (and not the rapid escalation associated with
             pregnancy, i.e. doubling time of 3-5 days) are acceptable.

         10. Patients of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must agree to use an acceptable
             form of birth control while on the study, i.e. condoms.

         11. Patients with second malignancies are eligible provided that the expected outcome from
             the second cancer is such that this will not interfere in the delivery of this
             therapy, or the assessment of response in the cystectomy specimen. The expected
             survival from the prior malignancy should reliably be > 4 years to be eligible for
             this study.

         12. Patients must be >/= 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             medication are eligible, as long as the blood pressure is </= 140/90 mmHg.

          4. Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

          5. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.

                  of protein in 24 hours to be eligible.

         15. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess

        a follicle stimulating hormone >40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value <40 pg/mL (<140 pmol/L).

        Subjects must discontinue HRT before study enrolment because of the potential for
        inhibition of cytochrome enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins. For most forms
        of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of

Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy. This clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone. All patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent. Recent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

","Genzyme, a Sanofi Company",Industry,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer,NSCLC,"A Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blinded, Multi-Center, Study to Assess the Efficacy of Docetaxel (TAXOTERE™) in Combination With ZD6474 (ZACTIMA™) Versus Docetaxel (TAXOTERE™) With Placebo in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLCThis large phase III clinical study is studying the effect of vandetanib (ZACTIMA) in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy. This clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone. All patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent. Recent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for ovarian or peritoneal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of paclitaxel plus cisplatin in treating patients who have residual disease after surgery to remove stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer. ,doc099

This clinical trial will test if the Endothelin A Receptor Antagonist ZD4054 (Zibotentan) can further improve survival compared with docetaxel alone. ZD4054 (Zibotentan) is a new type of agent, which is thought to slow tumour growth and spread by blocking Endothelin A receptor activity. This trial will look at the effects of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in hormone resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases compared with docetaxel. All patients participating in this clinical trial will receive docetaxel chemotherapy, which is a commonly used chemotherapy to treat prostate cancer in addition to other existing prostate cancer therapies. Half the patients will receive ZD4054 (Zibotentan), and half the patients will receive placebo in addition to docetaxel and other prostate cancer therapy. By participating in this trial there is a 50% chance that patients will receive an agent that may further slow the progression of the tumour.
